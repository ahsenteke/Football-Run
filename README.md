# FOOTBALL RUN
- I made a game from scratch and named Football Run. It was my idea and has a new concept. 
- I worked with a game artist and I realized that game art is very important. 
- I faced many problems because of SDKâ€™s integration. Also, mobile optimization was a very difficult process, but now the performance of my game is quite good.
- I added vibration, shop system, Unity Mediation SDK, Facebook SDK, Gameanalytics SDK.
